# Functional-Materials

In these projects, we analyzed Erbium properties in a dopled glass, comparing its properties to a host glass (file Erbium Doped Glass). 
Analyzed the functional process of Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapour Deposition (PECVD), in the clean room of INL.
Finally, various functional methods were analyzed to observe NiTi alloy's behaviour.
